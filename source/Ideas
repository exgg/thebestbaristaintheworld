Nadia is sharp, driven and uncomprimisng.  But still has a distant hidden wildness.



Hallam is like Naida driven, sharp and determined like no other.  But also has a hidden worry about the new venue, and keeping his crown. His perfection is presnet in other ways to Nadia.
Hallam wraps everyone around his finger.
The contradiction is that hes controling, however he doubts himself deep down, expeically with the quanitity of money hes now involvoed with.
